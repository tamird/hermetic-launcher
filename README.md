# Hermetic Launcher

Tiny, cross-platform native launchers that replace shell-script wrappers in Bazel.
A launcher resolves its target's runfiles, forwards arguments, and `exec`s the real
program — in ~16–30 KB, identically on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Why

Bazel rules often wrap tools in generated shell scripts to set up runfiles. Shell
scripts aren't portable: bash doesn't run on Windows, `.bat` doesn't run on Unix.
Hermetic Launcher replaces them with a small native binary that does the same job on
every platform. Each launcher is produced by byte-patching a prebuilt template, so a
build on *any* host can emit a launcher for *any* target platform — deterministically
and with byte-identical output.

---

## Use in Bazel

Add the module (toolchains for the prebuilt templates and finalizers register
automatically):

```python
# MODULE.bazel
bazel_dep(name = "hermetic_launcher", version = "<latest>")  # see the Bazel Central Registry
```

Wrap an executable with `launcher_binary`:

```python
load("@hermetic_launcher//launcher:launcher_binary.bzl", "launcher_binary")

launcher_binary(
    name = "hash_file",
    entrypoint = "@openssl",
    embedded_args = [
        "dgst",
        "-sha256",
        "$(rlocationpath :input.txt)",  # auto-resolved through runfiles
    ],
    data = [":input.txt"],
)
```

At runtime this resolves `openssl` and `input.txt` through runfiles and runs
`openssl dgst -sha256 /abs/path/to/input.txt`. Extra arguments are appended:

```bash
bazel run //:hash_file -- --extra-flag
# openssl dgst -sha256 /abs/path/to/input.txt --extra-flag
```

`RUNFILES_DIR`, `RUNFILES_MANIFEST_FILE`, and `JAVA_RUNFILES` are exported to the child
process so it can use Bazel's runfiles libraries.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `entrypoint` | label (required) | Executable to run. Always resolved through runfiles. |
| `embedded_args` | string list | Arguments baked into the binary. Support location expansion; any `$(rlocationpath …)` / `$(rlocationpaths …)` arg is auto-marked for runfiles resolution. |
| `data` | label list | Runtime files; included in the launcher's runfiles tree. |
| `transformed_args` | int list | Indices of args to resolve through runfiles (`0` = entrypoint, `1` = first `embedded_args` entry, …). Default `[]` auto-detects (entrypoint + `$(rlocationpath …)` args). An explicit list **replaces** the default — include `0` to keep resolving the entrypoint. `[-1]` disables all resolution. |

### Low-level rule API

For custom rules that need to build launchers programmatically, use the `launcher`
struct (e.g. to compute args dynamically, or build with `cfg = "exec"` for build-time
tools):

```python
load("@hermetic_launcher//launcher:lib.bzl", "launcher")

def _impl(ctx):
    exe = ctx.actions.declare_file(ctx.label.name)
    embedded, transformed = launcher.args_from_entrypoint(ctx.executable.tool)
    embedded, transformed = launcher.append_runfile(
        file = ctx.file.config, embedded_args = embedded, transformed_args = transformed)
    embedded, transformed = launcher.append_embedded_arg(
        arg = "--verbose", embedded_args = embedded, transformed_args = transformed)
    launcher.compile_stub(
        ctx = ctx, embedded_args = embedded, transformed_args = transformed,
        output_file = exe, cfg = "target")  # or cfg = "exec"
    ...
```

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `args_from_entrypoint(executable_file)` | Seed `(embedded_args, transformed_args)` with the entrypoint at index 0. |
| `append_runfile(file, …)` | Append a `File`, marked for runfiles resolution. |
| `append_embedded_arg(arg, …)` | Append a literal string argument. |
| `append_raw_transformed_arg(arg, …)` | Append a string argument marked for resolution. |
| `to_rlocation_path(file)` | Convert a `File` to its rlocation path string. |
| `compile_stub(ctx, embedded_args, transformed_args, output_file, cfg, template_exec_group, template_file)` | Run the finalizer to emit the launcher. `cfg` is `"target"` (default) or `"exec"`. |

Declare the relevant toolchains on your rule:

```python
toolchains = [
    launcher.finalizer_toolchain_type,
    launcher.template_toolchain_type,       # for cfg = "target"
    # launcher.template_exec_toolchain_type # for cfg = "exec"
]
```

## Standalone use (without Bazel)

The launcher is two binaries per platform, downloadable from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/hermeticbuild/hermetic-launcher/releases):

- **`runfiles-stub-<arch>-<os>`** — the *template*: a complete stub with placeholder
  bytes where the arguments go.
- **`finalize-stub-<arch>-<os>`** — the *finalizer*: patches a template's placeholders
  with concrete arguments and writes a ready-to-run launcher. It is pure byte patching,
  so it runs on any host and targets any platform.

```bash
# Bake `_main/echo` into a launcher and mark argument 0 for runfiles resolution.
finalize-stub --template runfiles-stub-x86_64-linux --transform 0 -o my_echo -- _main/echo

# A manifest maps runfiles paths to real paths (a runfiles directory works too).
echo '_main/echo /bin/echo' > manifest.txt

RUNFILES_MANIFEST_FILE=manifest.txt ./my_echo "hello" a b
# runs: /bin/echo hello a b
```

### `finalize-stub` options

```
finalize-stub --template <PATH> [OPTIONS] -- <arg0> [arg1 ...]

-t, --template <PATH>            Template binary to patch (required)
-o, --output <PATH>              Output path (default: stdout; chmod +x on Unix)
    --transform <N>              Mark embedded arg N (0–9) for runfiles resolution.
                                 Repeatable or comma-separated. Default: none.
    --fallback <N=PATH>          Fall back to PATH relative to the launcher for transformed
                                 arg N. Repeatable; at most one fallback per argument.
    --export-runfiles-env <B>    Export RUNFILES_DIR/RUNFILES_MANIFEST_FILE/JAVA_RUNFILES
                                 to the child. False preserves inherited values (default: true)
-v, --verbose                    Verbose output
```

Up to 10 embedded arguments (`arg0`–`arg9`), each ≤ 256 bytes. For a fallback-enabled
argument, the argument, a NUL separator, and its fallback share that 256-byte slot.
`arg0` is the program to execute; the rest are its leading arguments. Runtime arguments
are limited only by the target operating system's process invocation constraints.

### Runfiles discovery

At startup the finalized launcher locates runfiles in this order:

1. `$RUNFILES_MANIFEST_FILE`
2. `$RUNFILES_DIR`
3. `<executable>.runfiles_manifest`
4. `<executable>.runfiles/`

Each argument marked `--transform` is resolved through runfiles (manifest lookup or
directory join; tree-artifact prefixes supported). Without a fallback, absolute paths
(leading `/`) pass through unchanged. The launcher then appends its own runtime
arguments and replaces itself with the target.

For an argument with `--fallback N=PATH`, the runfiles result wins only when it
exists. Otherwise the launcher joins `PATH` to the parent of its OS-reported
executable path, converts separators for the target platform, and requires the
result to exist. The join preserves `..` components and does not depend on the
current working directory. Unix uses the path through which the launcher was
invoked, including a symlinked directory. Windows uses the physical image path
reported by `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`. Before Windows filesystem and process
APIs consume an absolute DOS or UNC path, the launcher normalizes it to
`\\?\C:\...` or `\\?\UNC\server\share\...` form. This avoids `MAX_PATH`
without depending on host policy or an application manifest; the complete child
command line remains subject to the `CreateProcessW` length limit. A fallback can
only accompany a relative embedded runfiles path; absolute embedded paths retain
their pass-through semantics. A missing runfiles tree is allowed when at least
one argument is transformed and every transformed argument has a fallback. With
no transformed arguments, the default environment export still requires
runfiles.

With `--export-runfiles-env=true`, a runfiles context used by the launch replaces
the child's inherited runfiles variables. If at least one fallback is selected
and no transformed argument resolves through runfiles, the launcher removes
those inherited variables rather than exporting an unrelated context. With
`--export-runfiles-env=false`, the child inherits the variables unchanged.
Fallbacks require a V2 template. V1 custom templates retain their existing
`--export-runfiles-env` behavior.

---

## How it works

```
runfiles-stub (template)           finalize-stub                  launcher
┌────────────────────────┐         patches placeholders:         ┌──────────────────────┐
│ argc / flags / arg0..N │  ──────▶  argc, transform flags,    ─▶│ same size, runs the  │
│   = placeholder bytes  │           args + in-slot fallbacks     │ embedded program     │
└────────────────────────┘                                       └──────────────────────┘
```

The finalizer scans the template for fixed-size placeholder byte patterns and
overwrites them in place — argument count, the runfiles-resolution bitmask, the
export-env flag, and argument strings. A fallback follows its argument's terminating
NUL in the same fixed-size slot; that nonempty suffix is the sole record that the
argument has a fallback. Output size equals template size, and the result is identical
regardless of which host produced it.

| OS | Arches | Entry | Syscall layer | Process exec | Notes |
|----|--------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Linux | x86_64, aarch64, s390x | custom `_start` | raw syscalls, no libc | `execve` | fully static (musl), zero deps |
| macOS | x86_64, aarch64 | `main` | libSystem | `execve` | finalizer re-signs ad-hoc (patching invalidates the Mach-O signature) |
| Windows | x86_64, aarch64 | `main` | Win32 (UTF-16) | `CreateProcessW` + wait | verbatim DOS/UNC API paths |

The stubs are `no_std` Rust with a static-arena allocator. Patched Mach-O binaries are
re-signed automatically by the finalizer.

### Supported platforms

Templates and finalizers are released for all seven targets above. Bazel toolchains are
auto-registered for **Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64, and Windows x86_64**;
the **s390x** and **Windows/aarch64** binaries ship in releases for standalone use.

---

## Build & test

Requires [Bazel](https://bazel.build) (see `.bazelversion`; Bazelisk picks it up).
Cross-compilation is handled entirely by Bazel via `rules_rs` and LLVM toolchains.

```bash
# Build every release binary (7 templates + 7 finalizers) into ./artifacts
bash tools/build-release-binaries.sh artifacts

# Tests
bazel test //integration-tests:integration_test   # finalize + run on the host platform
(cd e2e/bzlmod && bazel test //...)                # launcher_binary wrapping cc/go/py/sh
```

`flake.nix` provides a dev shell (Rust, Wine for Windows testing, gdb).

## Updating the prebuilt binaries

1. Check out the latest commit of `main` and create a `binaries-YYYYMMDD` tag, then push it:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag binaries-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   git push origin binaries-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```
2. The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds all 14 binaries and publishes a GitHub release with a `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
3. Once the release is published, run the updater and commit:
   ```bash
   bazel run //tools:update-binaries
   git add launcher/private/extensions.bzl
   git commit -m "chore: update prebuilt binaries to binaries-YYYYMMDD"
   ```
